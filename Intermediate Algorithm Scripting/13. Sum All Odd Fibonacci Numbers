Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

/**** js code *****/

function sumFibs(num) {
  var fib0 = 0;
  var fib1 = 1;
  var fib = 1;
  var sum = fib0;
  while ( fib <= num){
    if (fib % 2) {
        sum += fib1;
    }
    fib = fib0 + fib1;
    fib1 += fib0;
    fib0 = fib1 - fib0;
  }  
  return sum;
}

sumFibs(75024);
