Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.
The provided number may not be a prime.

/***** js code *****/

function sumPrimes(num) {
  var sum = 0;
  var b = true;  
  
  for (var i = 3; i <= num; i+=2){
    b = true;   // prime or not
    
      for (var p = 2; p < i; p++){        
        // if divisible then number is not prime
        if (i % p === 0) b = false;

      }
      
      if (b === true) sum += i;
  }
  
  return sum+2;  // cause counter was from 3 we add also 2
}
