Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.

For example, getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5) should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).

Likewise, getIndexToIns([20,3,5], 19) should return 2 because once the array has been sorted it will look like [3,5,20] and 19 is less than 20 (index 2) and greater than 5 (index 1).

/***** js code *****/


function getIndexToIns(arr, num) {

  var ar;
  arr.push(num);
  ar = arr;
  ar = ar.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});
  
  for (var x = 0; x < ar.length; x++)
    {
      if (num === ar[x]) 
        {
          return x;
        }
    }
  
  return ar;
}

getIndexToIns([2, 5, 10], 15);
